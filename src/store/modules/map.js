/**
        âœ¨  CONCEPT
        Use Vuex as abstraction layer for map.

    Pro:
        - One source for the whole UI, pull complexity from UI.
        - Flow of data is straightforward; if not, one knows where to look.
        - Don't do anything on ol/Map instance twice across components - faster code?
        - ... ?
    Con:
        - May be difficult to code, depending on task at hand ...
        - May lead to sync mistakes and infinite loops.
        - Would probably become a big module that's about copying/syncing.
        - ... ?

    PoC:
        - Done for zoom level, which is probably the easiest by far.
        - Not used (except to get the map object) in BackForward for comparison.
