                            <h1>Choosing a version number</h1>
<p>Masterportal versioning is done according to the rules of <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, matching the following pattern:</p>
<p><strong>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</strong></p>
<p>Version numbers following this are e.g. <code>0.0.1</code>, <code>1.0.0</code>, or <code>2.5.265</code>. In short, these rules are used:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>MAJOR</strong> number is increased on changes to the public API introducing incompatibilities to prior versions.</li>
<li>The <strong>MINOR</strong> number is increased on adding functionalities. The product remains compatible to the public API of previously released versions.</li>
<li>The <strong>PATCH</strong> number is increased on bug fixes that do not have any effect on the packageâ€™s API, also preserving backwards compatibility.</li>
</ol>
